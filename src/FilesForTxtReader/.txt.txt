IntelliJ IDEA

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
===============================================================================

  Windows Installation Instructions
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. Unpack the IntelliJ IDEA distribution file that you downloaded to
     where you wish to install the program. We will refer to this destination
     location as your {installation home} below.

  2. [OPTIONAL] Add the "{installation home}\bin" to your %Path% environment
     variable so that you may start IntelliJ IDEA from any directory.

  3. [OPTIONAL] To adjust the value of JVM heap size, create
      "%APPDATA%\JetBrains\IntelliJIdea2024.1\idea64.exe.vmoptions" file,
      and set the -Xms and -Xmx parameters. To see how to do this,
      you can reference the vmoptions file under "{installation home}\bin" as a model.

  4. Open the console, `cd` into "{installation home}\bin", and type:

       idea.bat

     to start the application. As a side effect, this will initialize various
     configuration files in the "%APPDATA%\JetBrains\IntelliJIdea2024.1" directory.

  [OPTIONAL] Changing location of "config" and "caches" directories
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  By default, IntelliJ IDEA stores all your settings under the "%APPDATA%\JetBrains\IntelliJIdea2024.1"
  directory and uses "%LOCALAPPDATA%\JetBrains\IntelliJIdea2024.1" as a data cache.
  If you want to change these settings,

  1. Open a console and `cd` into "%APPDATA%\JetBrains\IntelliJIdea2024.1"

  2. Create the file "idea.properties" and open it in a text editor.
     Set the idea.system.path and/or idea.config.path variables as desired,
     for example:

     idea.system.path=${user.home}/.IntelliJIdea2024.1/system
     idea.config.path=${user.home}/.IntelliJIdea2024.1/config

  3. Note that we recommend storing caches on a local disk with at least 1GB of free space.


Enjoy!
